HW 2 README


halfrate.py is a Python file and requires the numpy and scipy.io libraries to run. It is supposed to take in a wav file argument as a parameter, but this functionality has not been implemented yet. Submitting a shell version of this program before the official deadline since I likely will not have time to resubmit before 11 am on Wed 04/20.
