HW 2 README


halfrate.py is a Python file and requires the numpy and scipy.io libraries to run. It can only accept input wav files with a sampling rate of 48000 or 44100 samples per second. This program must be run in the command line using the following command: python halfrate.py <wav file name>. 

If there is more than 1 argument (or no additional argument) after the file name, there will be an error. 

The coeffs.txt file is included as the values contained therein need to be read in by the Python program.
